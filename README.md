Maybe other planets or density of air, anything interesting. Game? Angry birds?

300-600 people participating?

Extension ideas:
  - Angry Birds thing
  - Variable air density/pressure and account for gravity changing with height
  - Spherical Planet projection
  - GUI/App for projections
  - Short Paper
  - Up an inclined plane with bounces <span style="color:limegreen;">(seems very hard)</span>
  - Enter 2 countries and calculates trajectory needed for it to go from a to b and displays it on a 3d mini earth
